# Product-Showcase
#Prerequisites:
1. Code Editor: Install a code editor on your computer. Visual Studio Code is recommended.
2. Git: Install Git to clone the repository.

#Steps to Set Up the Project:
1. Clone the Repository:
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/roshansonweb/Product-Showcase.git
2. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code:
cd apple-product-showcase
code .
The code . command opens Visual Studio Code in the current directory.
3. Install Live Server Extension:
In Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view (click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for "Live Server" in the Extensions view search box.
Install the "Live Server" extension provided by Ritwick Dey.
4. Run Live Server:
Open the index.html file in Visual Studio Code.
Right-click anywhere in the HTML file and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
This will open your default web browser with the live version of your web page.

5. View the Website:
The website should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html or a similar address provided by Live Server.

6. Making Changes:
Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
Edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed.
Save the files, and the changes will automatically reflect in the browser due to Live Server.

Note: If you want to skip above steps and make it simple. Download the project folder and directly open the folder in any IDE for example Visual Studio Code. Try running "index.html" for output.
